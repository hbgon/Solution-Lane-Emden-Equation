Lane Emden Equation
=======

Solution to the Laneâ€“Emden equation using finite difference method for polytropic index 1.5 and 3. I've also calculated the typical mass for this index using a given value for the constant K and rho_c (central density).

Developed for the numerical exercise of Stellar Evolution, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.
